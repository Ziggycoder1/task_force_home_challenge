# Project Overview
The Interactive Photo Gallery is a web-based application that displays a grid of images. Users can click on a thumbnail to view the image in a larger, modal view. The gallery includes the following features:
•	Responsive grid layout of images.
•	Hover effect on thumbnails.
•	Modal view for displaying larger images and additional information.
•	Navigation within the modal view.
Files and Directories
•	index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the photo gallery.
•	styles.css: Contains the CSS styles for the gallery and modal.
•	scripts.js: Contains the JavaScript code for handling the gallery interactions.
•	Galleys: contains the images that are used.

Approach and Explanation
HTML Structure (index.html)
•	The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the gallery.
•	Each thumbnail image is wrapped in a div with the class thumbnail.
•	Each thumbnail has an overlay and a text section with a title and location.
CSS Styling (styles.css)
•	The CSS file defines styles for the body, gallery container, grid layout, thumbnails, overlays, and text.
•	The gallery is designed to be responsive, adjusting the grid layout based on screen size.
•	Hover effects are added to the thumbnails to provide visual feedback.
•	Overlays are used to display additional information when hovering over a thumbnail.

JavaScript Interactions (scripts.js)
•	JavaScript code is used to handle the interactions for displaying the modal view.
•	Event listeners are added to each thumbnail to open the modal with the clicked image.
•	The modal can be closed by clicking the close button or outside the modal content.
Features
•	Responsive Design: The gallery adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
•	Hover Effects: CSS transitions and transformations create smooth hover effects on thumbnails.
•	Modal View: JavaScript handles the opening and closing of the modal, displaying a larger version of the image and additional information.
Code Quality and Best Practices
General Practices
•	Modular Code: The code is organized into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to manage exceptions gracefully.
Web Development Best Practices
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is usable across different devices and screen sizes.
Semantic HTML: Uses appropriate HTML tags for better accessibility
